# TicTacToe-Minimax
A simple game where I've used the minimax algorithm as an opponent.

When the program is launched, on the console appears the input line "input command: " where the user should put in as a first-world "start" or "exit". 
If the exit is chosen, the game will finish. 
If the start is chosen, then it is needed to define players separated by space. 
Players should be chosen according to that list - "user", "easy", "medium", "hard". 
Then the game will begin. 
The user should input coordinates of the space of a board to put his token (X or O according of the turn).

Coordinats of the board are:

- 13 23 33
- 12 22 32
- 11 21 31
